# SampleWebServer

This is a simple web server that I have written in C# and a small sample site is included.
At the moment it doesn't handle multiple clients asynchronously, however I will be adding that soon.
It is designed to be very generic and minimal, and easily adapted.
Right now it caches the web pages, but can be easily modified for dynamic loading.
It also supports a basic framework for logic to be easily added upon serving specific pages.
